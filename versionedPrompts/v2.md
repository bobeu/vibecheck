VibeCheck Production Readiness & Enhanced Branding

Objective: Upgrade VibeCheck from a prototype to a production-ready Mini App by integrating Firestore for persistent state management, preparing the architecture for real AI endpoints, and evolving the UI to a vibrant "Celo Yellow & MiniPay Green" aesthetic.

UI/UX: The Celo-MiniPay Fusion Aesthetic
Goal: Modify the existing Celo-inspired design to a highly energetic and attention-grabbing aesthetic by strategically blending the primary Celo Yellow (#FCFF52) with the MiniPay Signature Green (#35D07F).

Color Palette Update:

Primary Accent: Celo Yellow (#FCFF52). Use this for critical CTAs (Upgrade/Pay buttons), active tabs, and primary score highlights.

Secondary Accent: MiniPay Green (#35D07F). Use this for subtle backgrounds, positive status indicators, and background gradients.

Backgrounds: Maintain a dark, clean background (e.g., dark gray or deep charcoal) to make the vibrant yellow and green pop.

Design Application:

Vibrancy Score Ring: Update the progress ring to use a vibrant Celo Yellow gradient.

Buttons: Ensure all interactive buttons (Pay, Upgrade, Add to Watchlist) use the Celo Yellow as their main color, giving them a high-contrast, energetic look.

Data Visualization: Use the Celo Yellow and MiniPay Green to visualize data points (e.g., in bar/line charts) to distinguish between Code Health, Community, and Tokenomics scores.

Feature Upgrade: Real-Time Watchlist using Firestore
Goal: Replace the current localStorage-based Watchlist with a secure, persistent, and real-time Firestore database implementation.

Firebase Setup: The app must utilize the provided global variables (__app_id, __firebase_config, __initial_auth_token) for initialization and authentication.

Authentication: Implement the sign-in logic using signInWithCustomToken (if token exists) or signInAnonymously (as a fallback). The userId, derived from auth.currentUser?.uid, will serve as the primary identifier. The user's complete userId must be clearly visible on the dashboard.

Data Structure (Private): Store user-specific data (Watchlist state, purchased reports) in the private user path: /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/watchlist.

Collection: watchlist

Document Fields: tokenId (string), name (string), vibrancyScore (number), isPremiumSlot (boolean).

Real-time Synchronization: Use onSnapshot to listen for real-time changes to the user's private watchlist and update the UI instantly.

Architecture: Preparing for Real AI Endpoints
Goal: Refactor the mock AI analysis and report generation logic into a clean, reusable asynchronous function that is ready to be swapped with a real API call.
Refactor generateReport(tokenId):

Create a new asynchronous function, fetchVibrancyReport(tokenId), which currently contains the mock logic.

The function should be structured to easily replace the mock setTimeout logic with a real fetch call to a hypothetical backend endpoint (e.g., /api/v1/report?token=...).

Ensure appropriate loading and error states are handled within this function and reflected in the UI.

💰 Mock Payment Refinement
Goal: Ensure the mock payment modal/logic uses the Celo Yellow/MiniPay Green palette and maintains the 1 cUSD/3 cUSD structure, providing clear success/failure feedback using the new color scheme.

Technical Summary for Noah AI:

Technology: React (Single File App.jsx).

Styling: Tailwind CSS (using new Celo Yellow/MiniPay Green palette).

Data Persistence: Integrate and utilize Firebase/Firestore for all persistent data (Watchlist/Purchased items).

Code Quality: Ensure all useEffect dependencies are correct, and all Firestore operations are guarded until authentication is complete (userId is available).
