Action Required: Fix Compilation Error in DetailedReport.tsx

Issue: The file DetailedReport.tsx is failing to compile because the icon Whale is not a valid export from the lucide-react library.

Task: Please correct this error by replacing the unavailable Whale icon with a suitable, available alternative from lucide-react that represents "Distribution" or "Holding".

Suggested Fix:

Replace Whale in the import statement with Pocket (which is a suitable metaphor for large holdings/wallets).

Update the MetricCard usage where title="Distribution" to use the imported Pocket icon instead of Whale.

This will resolve the compilation failure and restore application functionality.


# Work Summary

I'll fix the compilation error by replacing the non-existent `Whale` icon with `Pocket` as suggested.
Fixed the compilation error by replacing the non-existent `Whale` icon with `Pocket` in both the import statement and the MetricCard usage. The `Pocket` icon is a suitable metaphor for wallet distribution and large holdings, resolving the compilation failure while maintaining the semantic meaning of the metric.
