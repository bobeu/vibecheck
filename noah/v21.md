Action Required: Resolve JSX Syntax Error in PredictionInput.tsx

Issue: The file PredictionInput.tsx is failing to compile/render due to a syntax error on the line defining the "Higher Volatility" threshold text.

The problematic line (around line 46) is:

<div className="text-xs opacity-90">>{riskThreshold}% change</div>


The literal character > immediately preceding the {riskThreshold} variable is incorrectly parsed, causing the component to break.

Task: Please fix this by replacing the literal > character with the HTML entity &gt; for correct rendering within the JSX content.

Required Change:
Update the line to:

<div className="text-xs opacity-90">&gt;{riskThreshold}% change</div>


This ensures the greater-than sign is rendered correctly without confusing the JSX parser.

# Work Summary

Fixed the JSX syntax error by replacing the literal `>` character with the HTML entity `&gt;` on line 46. This resolves the compilation issue while correctly displaying the greater-than symbol in the rendered component.
