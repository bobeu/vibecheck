Project Name: VibeCheck (The Project Viability Predictor)
Goal: Design and build a production-ready, lightweight AI-driven Mini App that predicts the long-term viability of crypto projects, optimized exclusively for the Celo MiniPay environment.

Core Product: The Vibrancy Score (0-100), a single metric synthesizing Code, Community, and Tokenomics Health.

I. Celo/Minipay Constraints & Integration (CRITICAL)
Platform: Celo Blockchain, delivered as a Mini App (target size under 5MB bundle).
Transaction Currency: All user fees must be paid in cUSD or USDT.
Wallet Integration: DO NOT include a manual "Connect Wallet" button. Assume implicit MiniPay wallet connection. Implement transaction logic using Celo-compatible libraries (viem or wagmi), ensuring the feeCurrency is explicitly set to cUSD for all user-initiated transactions (1 cUSD Report purchase).
Aesthetic: Use a color palette that blends Celo's signature bright green/white with a complementary clean blue/cyan for data visualization, adhering to a clean, mobile-first design.
II. Core AI Features & Data Flow
Constraint: The AI/ML inference must be handled OFF-CHAIN on a scalable cloud backend (e.g., FastAPI on AWS Lambda/GCP Cloud Functions). The Frontend will only fetch pre-calculated scores via API.
Frontend Data Needs:
Code Health: Mock an endpoint returning a score based on a simulated LSTM model output.
Community FUD Index: Mock an endpoint returning a score based on a simulated NLP model output.
Vibrancy Score: Mock an endpoint returning the final composite score (0-100).
III. Lightweight Business Logic & Payment Flows
Primary Revenue Flow (Pay-Per-Report):
User selects a token (e.g., CGLD).
A large, clear modal appears: "Unlock Full Vibrancy Report for 1 cUSD."
Implement a function that initiates a 1 cUSD transfer to a designated smart contract/address using the MiniPay wallet.
Upon successful transaction confirmation, the app must display the full report.
Premium Watchlist Feature: Implement a "Watchlist" feature where a one-time payment of 3 cUSD unlocks the ability to track 5 tokens.
IV. Deliverables
A fully styled React/Next.js Mini App Frontend using the Celo/Minipay aesthetic.
Working cUSD payment logic integrated with the MiniPay wallet for the Pay-Per-Report feature.
A mocked Vibrancy Score API client to display the final 0-100 score and component breakdown on the report page, ready to be linked to the final AI backend.
