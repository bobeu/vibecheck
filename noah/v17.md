```

Revise the code to address the error 


# Work Summary

I'll fix the MetaMask connection error by improving the wallet service error handling to fail gracefully when MetaMask is not available.
The MetaMask connection error has been fixed with improved error handling that:
1. **Graceful Failure**: No longer breaks the app when MetaMask isn't available
2. **Better Error Messages**: Provides specific, user-friendly error messages for different failure scenarios
3. **Celo Focus**: Updated messaging to emphasize MiniPay and Celo-compatible wallets
4. **Enhanced Validation**: Added checks for wallet capabilities and account availability
5. **User-Centric**: Gives actionable feedback instead of technical error messages
The app will now handle wallet connection failures gracefully without crashing.
