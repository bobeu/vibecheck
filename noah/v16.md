NoahAI Vibecheck Universal App (React/Tailwind)

Objective: Create a single, fully responsive React (JSX) component file for the Vibecheck project. The application must dynamically adjust its UI and features based on the detected execution environment (MiniApp vs. Farcaster/Web).

1. Technical & Environment Constraints:

Format: Single file (.jsx) using functional components and modern hooks.

Styling: Use Tailwind CSS exclusively; ensure full mobile responsiveness.

Design: High-contrast, clean, and modern UI (e.g., dark mode theme, rounded corners, subtle shadows).

Icons: Use lucide-react (e.g., Zap, TrendingUp, ThumbsUp).

Component: Main component must be named App.

2. Context Detection Logic (Critical):
Determine the application environment by inspecting the browser's URL query parameters upon initialization (using new URLSearchParams(window.location.search)):

MiniApp Context: If the URL contains ?mode=miniapp, set state variable isMiniApp to true.

Farcaster/Web Context: If ?mode=miniapp is absent, set isMiniApp to false.

3. Conditional UI & Feature Requirements (Connection Logic):
| Feature | MiniApp Context (isMiniApp: true) | Farcaster/Web Context (isMiniApp: false) | Behavior |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| "Connect Wallet" Button | MUST BE HIDDEN | MUST BE VISIBLE | Implement a mock handleConnect function that logs: console.log('Wallet connection initiated for Farcaster/Web context.') when clicked. |
| User Greeting | Use "Welcome, Vibechecker!" | Use "Connect your wallet to begin!" (if not connected). | Use a state variable isWalletConnected (mocked as false initially). |

4. Core Vibecheck Feature (Mock Data):
Implement a Vibe Score Panel that renders consistently in both modes using the following hardcoded mock data for immediate display:

OVERALL VIBE SCORE: 7.8/10 (Style with a large, prominent number).

TOP TRENDING TOPIC: #Web3Elections

VIBE STATUS MESSAGE: "Community sentiment is currently Optimistic on long-term growth, but watch out for short-term sentiment shifts."

5. Implementation Note: The application must load and display the Vibe Score Panel immediately in both modes, but only show the Connect Button if isMiniApp is false.
